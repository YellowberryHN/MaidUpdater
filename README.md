# cm3d2-updater

This is my first C# project so the code is probably inefficient/messy

Anyways
I started this project with the goal of simplifying dlc/update installing for cm3d2 as it took a while
Right now it can only install one thing at a time but I have plans to add an install all/multi-select option

Download: https://github.com/thepotatomaster/cm3d2-updater/raw/master/bin/Debug/CM3D2%20Updater.exe

#Todo:
1. Add multi-select and install all options
2. Fix bug when the directory length is too long
3. Add registry fixer
4. Optimize code
5. ???

#Changelog: 
v0.1: Initial release
