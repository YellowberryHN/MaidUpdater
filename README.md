# ⬆️ Maid Updater
**Based on [this abandoned project](https://github.com/thepotatomaster/cm3d2-updater).**

### ⚠️ Use this tool at your own risk.
I've added several checks into the installation process to try to prevent your game from
getting bricked from a failed install, but there may be unexpected errors!
**Make a backup of your game install!**

# About
This is a tool that allows you to bulk install CM3D2 and COM3D2 updates and DLC packs.
It aims to completely replicate the behavior of the original updaters,
as well as giving you the ability to merge updates into a single pack.

### TODO:

- Multi-threaded so the app doesn't freeze
- Add storage space safety check (user doesn't have enough disk space)
- Transition from WinForms to WPF
- Prompt user to fix/add registry keys for game installs if broken/not present
- Improve UX
- Export merged update bundles, for convenience's sake
- Decouple business logic from UI, consolidate into C# library
- Create drop-in replacement for `update.exe` as a separate project using aforementioned library

# Changelog
- v0.2: Added most functionality.
- v0.1: Initial release.

# Contributing
Pull requests encouraged, I always appreciate a hand.
You can knock something off the TODO list, just clean up or add something new.
