# MaidUpdater

**Based on [this abandoned project](https://github.com/thepotatomaster/cm3d2-updater).**

## Do not use this right now. It's incomplete and will break your game install.

This is a tool that allows you to bulk install CM3D2 and COM3D2 updates and DLC packs.
It aims to completely replicate the behavior of the original updaters,
as well as giving you the ability to merge updates into a single pack.

# Changelog:
v0.1: Initial release

# License: 
The person who wrote the original never put a license on it, and I doubt they care about the code anymore,
so I've licensed it as [MIT](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/). If the original creator has problems
with that, feel free to reach out to me.
